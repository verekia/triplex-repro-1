# my-triplex-project

Thanks for being an early adopter!
If you find TRIPLEX useful think about [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/itsdouges),
with more sponsors more time can be spent on development!

## Commands

Run the CLI to browse available commands:

```bash
npx triplex
```

### Editor

TRIPLEX comes with an embedded editor used to visually build out your React Three Fiber scenes:

```bash
pnpm run editor
```

Using the `--open [path]` option you can have the editor open in your default browser immediately.
Pass the optional `[path]` flag to also open a specific file on open.
